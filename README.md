Alpha Release:
The team at Helmet is excited to release our first functioning version of Culturle!
Culturle is written in Kotlin, for Android, and is designed to run optimally on a Pixel 4a API 33.
Our proposed questionaire for volunteer testers can be found in the file Questionaire.pdf.


Known issues to be addressed asap:
  Generating documentation has drastically lowered our code quality as measured by Codacy.
  CodeCov is linked to our repo but isn't functional yet
  Much of our code is lacking comparmentalisation in the form of methods
