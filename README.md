Alpha Release:
The team at Helmet is excited to release our first functioning version of Culturle!
Culturle is written in Kotlin, for Android, and is designed to run optimally on a Pixel 4a API 33.
Our proposed questionaire for volunteer testers can be found in the file Questionaire.pdf.

In order to run and test Cultural on your own device: 1) Download the repo, 2) In Android Studio open the file "app" (COSC345-Helmet/culturle/app), 3) Create a device in "Device Manager" within Android Studio, search for and choose "Pixel 4a API 33". 4) Select the green hammer "Make Project" to build the app. 
5) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97869940/186905801-83cd22b8-167a-47d4-938f-d939cb58300d.png) 
The 'Run\Debug configuration' should resemble the image above. Run by pressing the green "Run app" button.

Notes:
  SharedPreferences will be saved on the emulated device. The emulated device will need to be reset in order to reset the SharedPreferences for repeated testing.

Known issues to be addressed asap:
  Generating documentation has drastically lowered our code quality as measured by Codacy.
  Documentation had been generated but isn't hosted on GitHub pages yet.
